# NodeSPL
Distributed framework to Sample, Process and Learn from multi-source signal data

## Overview
Goal:
A modular framework that allows multiple embedded nodes to send sensor data to a centralized server (especially medical domain). The server processes this data using configurable signal processing and regression algorithms and provides real-time visualization and API access.
